		<h2> Auto Cadd </h2>
		<p> AutoCAD is a commercial computer-aided design (CAD) and drafting software application. Developed and marketed by Autodesk, AutoCAD was first released in December 1982 as a desktop app running on microcomputers with internal graphics controllers. Before AutoCAD was introduced, most commercial CAD programs ran on mainframe computers or minicomputers, with each CAD operator (user) working at a separate graphics terminal. Since 2010, AutoCAD was released as a mobile- and web app as well, marketed as AutoCAD 360.AutoCAD is used across a wide range of industries, by architects, project managers, engineers, graphic designers, and many other professionals. It was supported by 750 training centers worldwide in 1994.</p>

		<h3> Staad.Pro </h3>

		<p> STAAD.pro is a structural analysis and design computer program originally developed by Research Engineers International at Yorba Linda, CA in 1997. In late 2005, Research Engineers International was bought by Bentley Systems.The commercial version, STAAD.Pro, is one of the most widely used structural analysis and design software products worldwide. It supports several steel, concrete and timber design codes.In recent years it has become part of integrated structural analysis and design solutions mainly using an exposed API called OpenSTAAD to access and drive the program using a Visual Basic macro system included in the application or by including OpenSTAAD functionality in applications that themselves include suitable programmable macro systems. Additionally, STAAD.Pro has added direct links to applications such as RAM Connection and STAAD.Foundation to provide engineers working with those applications which handle design post processing not handled by STAAD.Pro itself. Another form of integration supported by the STAAD.Pro is the analysis schema of the CIMsteel Integration Standard, version 2 commonly known as CIS/2 and used by a number modelling and analysis applications.</p>
